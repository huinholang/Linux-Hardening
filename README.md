# Linux-Hardening
Really nice Linux hardening scripts ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

The script is based on the knoledge built by the Experts who create the CIS Benchmark document (https://www.cisecurity.org/). Special thank's to:

https://github.com/radsec/CentOS7-CIS

Why it's really nice?
1. Written in Bash.
2. Working on:
- [x] CentOS
- [ ] Ubuntu/Debian
- [ ] SUSE
3. Easy to use.
How to:

`sudo chmod +x hardening-centos.sh`

`sudo ./hardening-centos.sh`
